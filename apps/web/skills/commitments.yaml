  Use the EA MCP tools to show the current state of all commitments.

  Call these tools:
  1. ea_get_commitments with overdue=true - Get all overdue items
  2. ea_get_commitments with direction="user_owes", status=["pending", "in_progress"] - Things you owe
  3. ea_get_commitments with direction="they_owe", status=["pending", "in_progress"] - Things owed to you

  Present the commitments as:

  **OVERDUE - Immediate Action Required**
  - Items you owe (most urgent first)
  - Items others owe you

  **YOU OWE (Pending)**
  - Sorted by due date, with person and context

  **THEY OWE YOU (Pending)**
  - Sorted by due date, with person and context

  Include:
  - Description and due date
  - Who it's with
  - Days overdue/until due
  - Source (email, meeting, manual)

  Highlight any items more than a week overdue.
