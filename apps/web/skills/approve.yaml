description: Show and approve pending automated actions from EA
prompt: |
  Use the EA MCP tools to show pending actions awaiting approval.

  Call these tools:
  1. ea_get_pending_actions - Get all pending automated actions

  Present the pending actions showing:
  - Action type (email draft, calendar change, etc.)
  - Description of what will happen
  - Confidence score and reasoning
  - Related person/entity

  For each action, offer options to:
  - Approve (execute the action)
  - Reject (cancel and don't do this)
  - Edit & Approve (for drafts)
  - Ask me next time (lower confidence threshold)

  If arguments include "all", batch approve all pending actions.
  If arguments include an action ID, approve that specific action.

  Show any recently executed automated actions as well.
