  Use the EA MCP tools to show the most important emails needing attention.

  Call these tools:
  1. ea_get_inbox with important=true, limit=20 - Get priority emails
  2. ea_get_inbox with unread=true, limit=10 - Get recent unread

  Present the inbox showing:
  - Emails from VIP/high-importance contacts first
  - Emails requiring action or response
  - Recent unread emails

  For each email, show:
  - Sender (with their importance/domain if known)
  - Subject
  - Brief summary or preview
  - When it was received
  - Suggested priority (respond now / respond today / FYI)

  Group by urgency if helpful. Highlight anything from VIP contacts.
