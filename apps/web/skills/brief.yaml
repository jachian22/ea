prompt: |
  Use the EA MCP tools to get today's daily brief and present it to me in a clear, actionable format.

  Call these tools in sequence:
  1. ea_get_daily_brief - Get the generated daily brief
  2. ea_get_commitments with overdue=true - Get any overdue commitments
  3. ea_get_commitments with upcoming=1 - Get commitments due today/tomorrow

  Present the information as:
  - Schedule overview for today
  - Priority inbox items needing attention
  - Commitments due today (separated by "you owe" and "they owe")
  - Overdue items that need immediate action
  - Any urgent insights or alerts

  Highlight anything that requires immediate action.
